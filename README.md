## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of New Brunswick focused on building secure, production-oriented backend systems.

I enjoy designing RESTful APIs, enforcing authentication and authorization flows, and thinking through edge cases in distributed systems. My work centers around reliability, clean architecture, and real-time service design.

I’m particularly interested in backend infrastructure, secure transaction systems, and cloud-native architectures.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### LazyDrop — Real-Time File Sharing Platform  
Spring Boot • PostgreSQL • WebSockets (STOMP) • Supabase • Stripe • Docker

- Designed secure backend services in Java Spring Boot for session-based file sharing.
- Implemented JWT authentication and role-based access control.
- Integrated Stripe billing with verified webhooks and server-side validation.
- Built idempotent file confirmation workflows to prevent duplicate processing.
- Enforced plan limits and session constraints server-side.
- Containerized backend with Docker and deployed via CI/CD.

Focus areas: authentication, idempotency, session management, real-time events.
